# sgcarmart-ds-project
My dad was recently looking into the used luxury sedan car market to scour for an affordable yet reliable option. So I decided to do a data analysis of the cars in the market and find out what are the brands available and how they are being priced. I will be scraping the data from sgcarmart and doing data cleaning and engineering before carrying out explaratory data analysis. 

## 1) Web-scraping
I am utilising BS4 from beautifulsoup to help me scrape the data as it is a fast and reliable library for web-scraping. I will be scraping the first 1000 car listings as of 11 Jan 2023. The information of the cars are the listing name, price, depreciation, mileage, engine capacity, registration date and number of previous owners. They will then be stored in the csv file (sg_used_cars.csv).
